## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER! ‚ö†Ô∏è 
THIS IS NOT A REAL ENCRYPTER! THIS IS JUST A SILLY LITTLE PROJECT I DID OUTSIDE OF MY SOFTUNI HOMEWORK. IT'S SOMETHING I DID FOR FUN AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!

VIKZCRYPT is a silly little tool that you can use to encrypt messages. It was inspired by a task i had during my studies that used cyphers to jumble letters and "encrypt" text.

As stated in the disclaimer this is NOT a real encrypter. It uses base64 encoding (lol) so pretty much anyone can crack it but hey, at least your mom will be impressed!

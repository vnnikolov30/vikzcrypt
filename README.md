## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER! ‚ö†Ô∏è 
THIS IS NOT A REAL ENCRYPTER! THIS IS JUST A SILLY LITTLE PROJECT I DID OUTSIDE OF MY SOFTUNI HOMEWORK. IT'S SOMETHING I DID FOR FUN AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!

VIKZCRYPT is a silly little tool that you can use to encrypt messages. It was inspired by a task i had during my studies that used cyphers to jumble letters and "encrypt" text.

As stated in the disclaimer this is NOT a real encrypter. It uses base64 encoding (lol) so pretty much anyone can crack it but hey, at least your mom will be impressed!

#

## REQUIREMENTS ‚öôÔ∏è
You can also find this in the requirements.txt

üî¥ YOU NEED TKINTER AND PYGAME INSTALLED IN ORDER TO RUN THE CODE! üî¥

Luckilly installing them is as easy as typing **`pip install pygame`** for pygame and **`pip install tk`** for tkinter in your terminal.

After that you're good to go! ‚úÖ

## DEMOüëΩ

![cryptdemo](https://github.com/vnnikolov30/vikzcrypt/assets/122814861/8223faec-826b-4901-9f09-c30f411e4cd5)

So as you can see it's as simple as it gets. Input the password (can be changed to whatever you want inside the vikzcrypt.py file), type your text into the field, click on "ENCRYPT" and VIOLA, your message is encrypted. 

To decrypt it just paste the jumbled text into the text field and click on "DECRYPT". A window will pop up with your decrypted message.

#

## How to change the password? üîí
By default the password is "123" but there is a way to change that! (kinda...)

In the vikzcrypt.py file navigate to the PASSWORD constant (line 8) and type whatever you want.

NOTEüî¥: 
In the .exe provided the password is the default one and you cant change it. If in the future i come back to this i will figure out a way to make the password change dynamic but for the time being if you use the .exe just know that you're stuck with "123"
